Windows:

  After installing from the rust-lang website, use Powershell and an editor like Notepad++ to write a few simple files.
  Powershell
    use the New-Item command to create a file
    then edit from File Explorer with NPP, save it with .rs extension
    use rustc in Powershell to compile
    This produces a .exe file
    run this file with ./blah.exe
    
    Example:
    
    New-Item helloworld.rs
    rustc helloworld.rs
    ./helloworld.exe
